# AQFAAT_Project
This repository is a documentation of the project I worked on for a semester at Carnegie Mellon University for a course called Advanced Quantitative Financial Analytics and Algorithmic Trading (AQFAAT). It involves the researching and backtesting of several trading strategies as well as hyperparameter optimization and testing for overfitting. Using different metrics available, I analyzed the stability and robustness of each strategy on historical data and finally, simulated real execution of the strategies by using a trading bot and a free Oanda paper trading API key.
